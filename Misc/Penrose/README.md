--This is some experimentation with setting CSS colors in a GTK+ widget. The drawing is
from

https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/stable/sec-custom-widgets.html.en

It is translated over to C from C++ and some things are simplified to help testing with CSS. There are also a couple of accessor functions that duplicate the CSS functionality. That way you can change the background and foreground using CSS or the accessor functions.
