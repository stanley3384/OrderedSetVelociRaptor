These are the main references used for putting the application together. If you want to change the code in the program, these are the references that will be the most helpful. Also there is a lot of information on the internet for using GTK+, SQLite and Gnuplot. Both GTK+ and SQLite have excellent developer websites and there are a lot of available examples for Gnuplot. You are encouraged to give a little math and coding a try.
