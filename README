The VelociRaptor program requires a number of dependencies to compile. The following is how to get the required dependencies for the program on a computer running Ubuntu.

Start with installing apophenia and the libraries apophenia depends on.

From Ben Klemens README on
https://github.com/b-k/Apophenia
Dependencies for Apophenia. 

sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev libblas-dev libblas3gf liblapack3gf sqlite3 libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev

--There is an optional Python interface, which will require all of the above plus the
swig and Python-dev packages.

--Once you have it in place,

tar xzf apophenia-*.tar.gz 
cd apophenia-X.XX
./configure; make; sudo make install

After Apophenia is installed, install GTK+, gfortran and gnuplot.

sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev gnuplot gfortran

That should be all for the dependencies. Next, create a new folder and extract the VelociRaptor-*.tar.gz file to the empty folder. 
cd /home/.../new folder
tar xzf VelociRaptor-*.tar.gz 
make 
and it will build the VelociRaptor program. Run it with
./VelociRaptor
