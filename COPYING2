This software is licensed under the GNU GPL v2, with two modifications,
as follows:

--An application hosted on a server and remotely operated by users, such
as a web application or database server, is understood to be distribution
of the software, and therefore all GPL v2 clauses regarding distribution
apply. For example, a web application must include a link for downloading
the application source code.

--You are explicitly granted permission to link this software to other 
code licensed under other licenses, such as GPL v3 or the BSD license.
Linking to a differently-licensed code base does not free this code (or
the combination) of the stipulations of the GPLv2 plus the above clause.
